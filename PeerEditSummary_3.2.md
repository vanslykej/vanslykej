This is a very good start to Mikey's proposal. I thought his motivation and explanation for his project was very clear and he has a very well thought out plan for completion. The method for the experiment is very thorough and he has a good grasp on the subject matter for whole slide imaging. I also think this project is very relevant because he has a personal connection to the topic and the results will be very telling. Overall, this rough draft is a great start and he just needs to add a title, abstract, and go more in depth about the processes that he will go about completing in order to complete the proposal.
